The “Community” API key is limited to 10,000 calls per month. In order to accommodate using the same API key for multiple geographies, the airvisual integration will automatically “re-level” the time between API calls so as to not overrun the call limit.

For example:

One instance of the integration: API calls every 5 minutes
Two instances of the integration: API calls every 10 minutes
etc.
